## AI Awareness Reflection
**AI Tool Explored:** ChatGPT  
- **How it helped (or confused) during setup:**  
  I used ChatGPT to double-check commands for creating and activating a virtual environment and to confirm that my VS Code interpreter was set correctly. It helped me troubleshoot without guessing.  
- **How I will verify its suggestions in the future:**  
  I’ll always test AI suggestions myself, cross-check official documentation, and only use AI for learning and guidance, not to write assignments for me.
